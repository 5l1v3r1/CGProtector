How to link BoxedApp SDK statically
------------------------------------

To use BoxedAppSDK as a OBJ (i.e. link BoxedApp SDK statically) add unit 
'BoxedAppSDK_Static.pas' to a project;
the final EXE DOESN'T need BoxedAppSDK.dll
Sometimes it's useful when you should create single EXE without additional
dependencies.
